# SEP3SocketExample

The purpose of this repo is to give examples of how to communicate between Java and C#.
I have made a Java project and a C# project.
In each project is a client class and a server class.
Both the C# and Java client is able to send to and receive from the Java and the C# server. So:

* Java <-> Java
* Java <-> C#
* C# <-> Java
* C# <-> C#

These classes are suffixed with 'A' and 'B'.

I'm currently using sockets, it looks very low level, with some binary hoop jumping. 
Planning on updating with a version 2.0 soon.
